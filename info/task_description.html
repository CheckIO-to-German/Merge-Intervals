<p>
    You have a collection of intervals. You should merge overloped intervals.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A list of tuples. Each tuple has two elements, both are int. The elements show beginning and ending of interval.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A list of tuples, that has the same structure as input value.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
<pre class="brush: python">
    merge_intervals([(1, 4), (2, 6), (8, 10), (12, 19)]) == [(1, 6), (8, 10), (12, 19)]
    merge_intervals([(1, 12), (2, 3), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 12)]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    intervals are sorted inside the list by first element; the first element of interval is always bigger than the second one.
