<p>
    You are given a collection of intervals, as tuples. It is your task to minimize the number of intervals by merging those that intersect.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A collection of intervals as a list of tuples.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The merged intervals as a list of tuples, sorted by their first element.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
<pre class="brush: python">
merge_intervals([(1, 4), (2, 6), (8, 10), (12, 19)]) == [(1, 6), (8, 10), (12, 19)]
merge_intervals([(1, 12), (2, 3), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 12)]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>

<pre>intervals == sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0]) # you have sorted intervals
interval[0] < interval[1] </pre>
